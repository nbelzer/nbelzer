Hey there! After completing my masters in Computer Science this year I am now learning some of the more practical aspects of CS by experimenting with Swift and building [ShiftR](https://nickbelzer.me/projects/shiftr.html) using Ruby on Rails. You can find some of my experiences in my [portfolio](https://nickbelzer.me) and in my [digital garden](https://notes.nickbelzer.me) where I started to document the things I learn. If you like my work you can reach out to me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/nickbelzer).
