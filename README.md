Hey there! I am working on my masters in Computer Science, next to this I'm learning some of the more practical aspects of CS by experimenting with Swift and contributing to the open source community. You can find some of my experiences in my [digital garden](https://notes.nickbelzer.me) where I started to document the things I learn. If you like my work you can reach out to me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/nickbelzer) or [buy me a coffee ☕️](https://buymeacoff.ee/nbelzer).
